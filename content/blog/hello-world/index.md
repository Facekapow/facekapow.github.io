Hello, world!

Look at some `inline code`!

Here's a code sample with line 4 highlighted:

```cpp{4}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;

  // just adding more lines
  // in order to get the line numbers
  // all the way into double digits

  return 0;
};
```

Here's a blockquote:

> hi
> hey

<div class="block info">

> You should know: I like hot dogs.
>
> You heard me! I. like. **Hot dogs**.

</div>

<div class="block warn">

> Be careful when you're out and about!
>
> You might run into... the ***boo-monster***!

</div>
