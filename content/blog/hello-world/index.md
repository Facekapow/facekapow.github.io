Hi there! This is my first blog post on my new personal blog: Stuff & Things.

My blog is basically about whatever's on my mind at the time. Usually&mdash;like maybe 95% of the time&mdash;I'm writing
about computers, software, or programming. Sometimes, though, I like to go on a little rant about whatever's getting
on my nerves that particular day.

For now there's nothing to really see here, unless you want to look at this cool picture of a lion cub I found:

{A lion cub, by gmacfadyen on Flickr[^1]}![A lion cub](lion-cub.jpg "A lion cub")

I'm basically going to use the rest of this post to test out some of the styles I have so... here I go:

```js
let thisIs = 'some javascript'

// alright everyone, get the "what is `this`?" jokes out of your
// system now and let's get this over with
```

```cpp{5}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  // look! the next line is highlighted because it's important!
  std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;

  return 0;
};
```

  * This is
  * A bulleted
  * List

Hi.

  1. And this
  2. Is a
  3. Numbered list

Note that I had to add content to separate the two lists, because otherwise Remark.js will interpret the second list as a continuation of the first.
